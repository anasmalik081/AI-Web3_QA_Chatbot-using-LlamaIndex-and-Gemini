# AI & Web3 QA System
**A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system powered by LlamaIndex and Gemini.**

This end-to-end project integrates state-of-the-art AI technology with a user-friendly Streamlit interface to create a domain-specific QA chatbot for **AI and Web3**.

## 🎯 Features
- **Custom Knowledge Base**: Trained with AI and Web3 datasets for accurate responses.
- **RAG Framework**: Combines retrieval from knowledge sources with generative capabilities for context-rich answers.
- **Streamlit Integration**: A simple yet powerful UI for users to interact with the chatbot.
- **End-to-End Solution**: From backend data processing to frontend serving.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Backend**: LlamaIndex, Gemini, Python
- **Frontend**: Streamlit
- **Other Tools**: Pandas, OpenAI API, LangChain

## 🚀 Getting Started
